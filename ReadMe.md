### Abstract

Species distribution records are a prerequisite to follow climate-induced range shifts across space and time. However, synthesizing information from various sources such as peer-reviewed literature, herbaria, digital repositories and citizen science initiatives is not only costly and time consuming, but also challenging, as data may contain thematic and taxonomic errors and generally lack standardized formats to enable interoperability. To address this gap, we gathered ~1.1 million records of 706 important marine ecosystem-structuring species of large brown algae and seagrasses. 

We provide a curated dataset, taxonomically standardized, dereplicated and treated according to the physiological and biogeographical traits of species. Specifically, an automatic flagging system was developed to sign potentially incorrect records reported on land, outside ecological niches (such as limiting thermal and light conditions) and beyond dispersal capacities. The accuracy of the final records was validated based on the most recent published information about the species range distribution. 

We document the procedure and provide a ready to use dataset in tabular and geospatial vector data formats, alongside with a set of functions in R language for data management and visualization.

Figure. Dataset of marine forest species of (a) brown algae (orders Fucales, Laminariales and Tilopteridales) and (b) seagrasses (families Cymodoceaceae, Hydrocharitaceae, Posidoniaceae and Zosteraceae). Red and gray circles depict pruned and unpruned data, respectively. Orange circles depict occurrence records from the World Atlas of Seagrasses45 (version 6.0), available at http://data.unep-wcmc.org/datasets/7 with copyright licensed by UNEP and managed by UNEP-WCMC.

### R functions for data management and visualization

We provide a set of functions in R language to facilitate extraction, listing and visualization of occurrence records. The functions can be easily installed by entering the following line into the command prompt:

<br>

Function | Description | Arguments
------------ | ------------- | -------------
extractDataset() | Imports data to R environment | group (character), pruned (logical)
listTaxa() | Lists available taxa | --
listData() | Lists data available in a dynamic table | extractDataset object name  (character), taxa (character), status (character)
listDataMap() | Lists data available in a map | extractDataset object name  (character), taxa (character), status (character),radius (integer), color (character), zoom (integer)
subsetDataset() | Subsets available data to a specific taxon | extractDataset object name (character), taxa (character), status (character)
exportData() | Exports available data to a text delimited file or shapefile (geospatial vector data for geographic information systems) | extractDataset object name (character), taxa (character), status (character), file type (character), file name (character)

### Example of main functions use

1. listTaxa()
2. dataset <- extractDataset("seagrasses",pruned=TRUE)<br>
3. getTaxonomyWorms("Zostera marina")<br>
4. listData(dataset,taxa="Zostera (Zostera) marina",status="accepted")<br>
5. listDataMap(dataset,taxa="Zostera (Zostera) marina",status="accepted",radius=3,color="Black",zoom=4)<br>
6. exportData(dataset,taxa="Zostera (Zostera) marina",status="accepted",type="shp",file="myfile")

<br>

1. dataset <- extractDataset("brownAlgae",pruned=TRUE)<br>
2. getTaxonomyWorms("Laminaria digitata")<br>
3. listData(dataset)<br>
4. listDataMap(dataset,taxa="Laminaria digitata",status="accepted",radius=2,color="Black",zoom=2)<br>
5. exportData(dataset,taxa="Laminaria digitata",status="accepted",type="csv",file="myfile.csv")

<br>

1. dataset <- extractDataset("brownAlgae",pruned=TRUE)<br>
2. getTaxonomyWorms("Laminaria digitata")<br>
3. myDataFrame <- subsetDataset(dataset,taxa="Laminaria digitata",status="accepted")
